# My Python Project

This is a simple project to demonstrate how packages and module importing work in Python.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `package1`: A Python package containing `module1.py`.
- `package2`: A Python package containing `module2.py`.
- `tests`: A directory containing tests for the application.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_imports.py
```
